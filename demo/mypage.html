		<p id="art1">
			 Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline
			 in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves 
			 of optimism,[5][6] followed by disappointment and the loss of
			 funding (known as an "AI winter"),[7][8] followed by new 
			 approaches, success and renewed funding.[6][9] AI research  
			  has tried and discarded many different approaches since its
			   founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human 
			   problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge 
			   and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 
			   21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning
			    has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly 
				successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout
				 industry and academia.

			The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Churchâ€“Turing thesis.[17] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[18] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".

			+A representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.[49] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows. The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.
