        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline
        in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves 
        of optimism,[5][6] followed by disappointment and the loss of
        funding (known as an "AI winter"),[7][8] followed by new 
        approaches, success and renewed funding.[6][9] AI research  
         has tried and discarded many different approaches since its
          founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human 
          problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge 
          and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 
          21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning
           has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly 
           successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout
            industry and academia.
